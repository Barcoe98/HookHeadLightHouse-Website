<p>The lighthouse guarding the entrance to Howth Harbour is, without doubt, a scenic treat. Here you have an old building that inherently personifies both the longing for travelling abroad, and the home-sickness experienced when doing so. It can be seen as a farewell, and as a welcome. As a symbol of adventurous travels, a symbol of returning home. But for anybody interested in Irish history it is also a symbol for the fight for Irish independence, as a small plaque at the lighthouse will tell you.</p>
