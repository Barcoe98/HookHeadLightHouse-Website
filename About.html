<h2>The History of Howth Lighthouse</h2>
<p>It might be said that the mighty lighthouse was a costly mistake, in the context of the far costlier mistake that was Howth Harbour itself - only a fairly small quay existed here since the 17th century, used by local fishermen and as a convenient point to unload coal and supplies for the lighthouse on Howth Head (later replaced by the Baily Lighthouse).</p>

<p>Only around 1800 it was decided that Howth would make a good alternative to the Pigeonhouse Packet Station, and that a new harbor should be built here.</p>

<p>The first stone of Howth's new harbour was laid in 1807, granite stone used in construction was quarried locally (at Kilrock), the economy boomed. And faltered almost immediately, as sand and mud proceeded to fill the harbor in record time, and maintaining a sufficient depth for the packet ships from Holyhead (Wales) proved to be a never-ending, costly enterprise. Too expensive to keep up. Nonetheless, in January 1818 the lighthouse was completed, though the light was not lit due to red tape. So when the Post Master General of England decided that packets would stop at Howth from July of the same year (transferring that business to Dun Laoghaire), things became a bit hectic.</p>

<p>Mainly due to the fact that the "completed" lighthouse was not really up to scratch and hasty improvements had to be made. But finally, on July 1st, 1818, a fixed red light with twelve oil lamps went into operation. In a stout tower approximately 14.5 metres high and very similar to the Rennie design that already was in operation near Holyhead. Only 18 years later, the Treasury raised the inconvenient question whether Howth Harbour Lighthouse needed to be lit at all, due to the loss of the packets to Dun Laoghaire.</p>

<p>Inspector Halpin, on behalf of the Commissioners, made a case that the Treasury did not provide funds and that Howth Harbour was still somehow useful as a harbor of refuge in emergencies. So they kept her lit. With outdated technology.</p>

<p>Only after the <a href="http://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii" target="_blank">Second world war</a>, electricity as a means of lighting was considered. And finally installed - a 250 Watt lamp on battery power (constantly recharged by mains electricity) replaced the old oil lighting in early 1955. Which lasted until 1982 - as during the modernization of Howth Harbour the lighthouse was effectively made redundant by a small new tower and powerful light on the East Pier Extension. However, Howth Harbour Lighthouse was retained in its original (but unlit) form, still serves as a day mark, an aid to navigation in good conditions.</p>

<h2>Howth Harbour Lighthouse in Irish History</h2>
<P>Howth Harbour Lighthouse became the setting for a momentous event when on July 26th, 1914, the author Erskine Childers (his "The Riddle of the Sands" is still a first class spy thriller) arrived here with supplies for the Irish Volunteers. Illegal supplies. Sailing in on his private yacht "Asgard", Childers was effectively gun-running and brought a cache of arms into Ireland. There is a slight irony in the fact that Childers had warned against a German invasion of England in his bestseller ... but had sailed from Hamburg to Howth with arms supplied by the Germans, to be used against the British forces.</P>

<P>And with history's tendency to move from the sublime to the ridiculous, Childers was later executed for the possession of an illegal weapon during the Irish Civil War. A pistol he had been presented as a token of thanks for his gun-running activities.</P>
